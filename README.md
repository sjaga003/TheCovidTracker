# Getting Started

Run npm start to run this locally or head to [the demo](http://thecovidtracker.xyz/)

## Inspiration

I was inspired by looking at COVID numbers on the news, as daily cases have started to increase rapidly.

## What it does

Pulls data from the a COVID tracker database and interprets it into easily readable information with a clean UI.

## How I built it

I used React as the base for the project and pulled data using https://covidtracking.com/

## Challenges I ran into

The main challenge I ran into was the time crunch as my power was out for about 2 hours, so I was not able to get all that I wanted done.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm proud of making what is in my opinion a clean UI/UX for this project.

## What I learned

I learned about using libraries of React components and how to successfully implement them.

## What's next for Covid Tracker

I was hoping to have enough time to do state by state level statistics, so that is what I will continue to add this project.
